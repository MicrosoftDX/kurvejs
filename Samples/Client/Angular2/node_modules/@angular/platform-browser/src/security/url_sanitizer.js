/**
 * A pattern that recognizes a commonly useful subset of URLs that are safe.
 *
 * This regular expression matches a subset of URLs that will not cause script
 * execution if used in URL context within a HTML document. Specifically, this
 * regular expression matches if (comment from here on and regex copied from
 * Soy's EscapingConventions):
 * (1) Either a protocol in a whitelist (http, https, mailto or ftp).
 * (2) or no protocol.  A protocol must be followed by a colon. The below
 *     allows that by allowing colons only after one of the characters [/?#].
 *     A colon after a hash (#) must be in the fragment.
 *     Otherwise, a colon after a (?) must be in a query.
 *     Otherwise, a colon after a single solidus (/) must be in a path.
 *     Otherwise, a colon after a double solidus (//) must be in the authority
 *     (before port).
 *
 * The pattern disallows &, used in HTML entity declarations before
 * one of the characters in [/?#]. This disallows HTML entities used in the
 * protocol name, which should never happen, e.g. "h&#116;tp" for "http".
 * It also disallows HTML entities in the first path part of a relative path,
 * e.g. "foo&lt;bar/baz".  Our existing escaping functions should not produce
 * that. More importantly, it disallows masking of a colon,
 * e.g. "javascript&#58;...".
 *
 * This regular expression was taken from the Closure sanitization library.
