# Angular 2 QuickStart with KurveJS for MS Graph
This is a simple Angular 2 application build using the Angular 2 Quickstart template, but modified with KurveJS to handle authentication with Azure AD and calls into the Microsoft Graph. Here are the following steps to run the app:

1. npm install
2. npm start

The primary application logic is contained in the **app.appcomponent.ts** file. Both v1 and v2 AAD flows are implemented, although v1 is commented out.
